1 - Only basic projects or coursework
```

**Achievement Quality Assessment:**
```
Achievement Evaluation Criteria:

Quantification (1-5):
5 - All achievements include specific, impressive metrics
4 - Most achievements quantified with good metrics
3 - Some quantification, metrics are reasonable
2 - Limited quantification, vague metrics
1 - No quantification or very weak metrics

Business Impact (1-5):
5 - Clear connection to revenue, cost savings, or major efficiency gains
4 - Good evidence of business value
3 - Some business context provided
2 - Limited business relevance
1 - No business context
```

### Stage 3: Calibration and Consistency

**Regular Calibration Sessions:**

## Best Practices for Fair Screening

### Reducing Unconscious Bias

**Company Name Bias:**
- Focus on what candidates accomplished, not just where
- Look for growth and impact regardless of company size
- Value diverse company experiences (startup to enterprise)
- Consider role relevance over company prestige

**Educational Background Bias:**
- Emphasize practical skills over educational pedigree
- Value alternative education paths (bootcamps, self-taught)
- Focus on recent relevant experience for experienced candidates
- Consider work experience quality over educational credentials

**Communication Style Bias:**
- Allow for different resume formats and styles
- Focus on content quality over perfect English (for non-native speakers)
- Value substance over eloquent presentation
- Consider cultural differences in self-promotion

### Creating Inclusive Screening Criteria

**Technical Requirements:**
- Distinguish between "must-have" and "nice-to-have" skills
- Allow for equivalent experience (e.g., similar frameworks)
- Consider transferable skills from related technologies
- Value learning ability over current skill inventory

**Experience Evaluation:**
- Credit non-traditional career paths
- Value diverse industry experience
- Consider part-time, contract, and freelance work
- Recognize achievements in smaller companies or teams

**Achievement Standards:**
- Adjust expectations based on company size and resources
- Value process improvements and team contributions
- Recognize achievements in constrained environments
- Consider individual contributions within team successes

## Common Screening Mistakes to Avoid

### Mistake 1: Over-Relying on Keywords

**Problem:**
Rejecting qualified candidates who use different terminology for same technologies or concepts.

**Solution:**
- Create synonym lists for technologies (e.g., JS/JavaScript, React/ReactJS)
- Train screeners on technology equivalencies
- Look for conceptual understanding over exact keyword matches
- Allow candidates to explain their experience in different terms

### Mistake 2: Unrealistic Requirements

**Problem:**
Requiring extensive experience in multiple unrelated technologies or expecting senior-level achievements from mid-level candidates.

**Solution:**
- Regular review of job requirements for realism
- Benchmark requirements against successful current employees
- Prioritize core skills over comprehensive skill lists
- Adjust expectations based on local talent market

### Mistake 3: Inconsistent Standards

**Problem:**
Different screeners applying different criteria or standards fluctuating based on number of applications.

**Solution:**
- Written scoring rubrics used by all screeners
- Regular calibration meetings to align standards
- Documentation of decision rationales
- Quality reviews of screening decisions

### Mistake 4: Overemphasis on Perfect Fit

**Problem:**
Only advancing candidates who match every requirement exactly, missing high-potential candidates with transferable skills.

**Solution:**
- Focus on learning ability and growth potential
- Value adjacent experience and quick learning
- Consider candidates who exceed requirements in some areas
- Allow for skill development during onboarding

## Effective Communication with Candidates

### Rejection Communication

**Bad Example:**
"We've decided to move forward with other candidates who are a better fit for this role."

**Good Example:**
"Thank you for your application for the Senior React Developer position. While your experience with Vue.js demonstrates strong frontend skills, this particular role requires 3+ years of React experience. We encourage you to apply for future positions that match your skillset."

### Setting Clear Expectations

**Job Description Best Practices:**
