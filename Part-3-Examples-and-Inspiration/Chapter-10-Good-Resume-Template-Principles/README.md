# Chapter 10: Good Resume Template Principles

Creating an effective resume template requires balancing visual appeal with functionality, scannability, and ATS compatibility. This chapter outlines the principles behind effective resume design and provides guidelines for creating or choosing templates.

## Core Design Principles

### 1. Hierarchy and Visual Flow

**Information Hierarchy:**
Your resume should guide the reader's eye through information in order of importance:

1. **Contact Information** - most prominent
2. **Professional Summary** - if included
3. **Key Skills** - easily scannable
4. **Recent Experience** - most detailed
5. **Earlier Experience** - condensed
6. **Education** - appropriate to experience level
7. **Additional Sections** - supporting information

**Visual Techniques for Hierarchy:**
- **Font sizes**: Larger for more important elements
- **Font weights**: Bold for emphasis, regular for details
- **White space**: More space around important sections
- **Color**: Subtle accent colors for section headers (if used)
- **Positioning**: Most important information in upper third of page

### 2. Scannability and Readability

**The 10-Second Test:**
Your resume should communicate key qualifications within 10 seconds of scanning:

- **Clear section headers** that stand out
- **Bullet points** instead of paragraphs
- **Consistent formatting** that doesn't distract
- **Strategic white space** that prevents cramping
- **Logical flow** that matches reader expectations

**Typography Best Practices:**
- **Font choice**: Professional fonts (Arial, Calibri, Helvetica, Times New Roman)
- **Font size**: 10-12pt for body text, 14-16pt for headers
- **Line spacing**: 1.0-1.15 for readability without waste
- **Character spacing**: Default or slightly increased for clarity
- **Contrast**: High contrast between text and background

### 3. ATS Compatibility

**ATS-Friendly Design Elements:**
- **Simple layout structure** without complex formatting
- **Standard section headers** that ATS systems recognize
- **Text-based content** rather than images or graphics
- **Consistent formatting** throughout the document
- **No headers/footers** with essential information

**ATS Problem Elements to Avoid:**
- Tables for layout structure
- Text boxes or complex shapes
- Images with embedded text
- Unusual fonts or characters
- Headers and footers with key information
- Multiple columns for main content

**Avoid:**

### Font Size Hierarchy

**Recommended Sizes:**

### Color Usage Guidelines

**Professional Color Approaches:**

**Monochromatic (Safest):**
- Black text on white background
- Gray for less important information
- Bold for emphasis

**Subtle Accent (Modern):**
- Navy blue for headers
- Dark gray for main text
- Light gray for dates/locations

**Color Psychology in Resume Design:**
- **Navy Blue**: Trust, professionalism, stability
- **Dark Gray**: Modern, sophisticated, neutral
- **Green**: Growth, balance (use sparingly)
- **Avoid**: Red (aggressive), bright colors (unprofessional)

### Spacing and Layout

**White Space Strategy:**
- **Margins**: 0.5-1 inch on all sides
- **Section spacing**: 0.2-0.3 inches between sections
- **Line spacing**: 1.0-1.15 for readability
- **Bullet spacing**: Consistent throughout

**Alignment Principles:**
- **Left align** all text (most scannable)
- **Right align** dates (clean appearance)
- **Center align** only contact information
- **Justify** avoid (creates awkward spacing)
