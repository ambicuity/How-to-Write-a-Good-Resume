# Chapter 2: The Hiring Pipeline

Let's look at the bigger picture of what the interview process looks like, to better understand why a good resume is so important. This process can often seem like a black hole. It could also feel like a hard-to-predict series of interactions with people until you—hopefully—get an offer.

Hiring managers and recruiters look at this process quite differently and call it the **Hiring Pipeline**. Why this name? It's because at every stage, there's a significant dropoff in the number of candidates still in the pipeline.

## People in the Recruitment Process

Throughout the hiring process, you'll interact with several people. Still, there are even more whom you might not be aware of. Let's take a look at each of the roles, their goals, and why you should care about these.

### The Hiring Manager

**The hiring manager** is the most important person in the whole process, and they run the show. They are the person who has opened one or more positions—or headcounts, as it's internally called. They define the requirements they are looking for, and they usually write the job description. They set up the hiring process and define who the technical interviewers will be, and what areas they should focus on. They are the ones who have the final hire/no-hire decisions. Candidates usually don't talk to the hiring manager until they come onsite. The goal of the hiring manager is to hire people onto their team who will help this team excel.

### The Recruiter

**The recruiter** coordinates everything on the recruitment side. From the point of a profile being promising, they are in touch with the candidate, guiding them through the interview process. There are several other recruitment responsibilities, which sometimes have dedicated people at larger companies. The goal of the recruiter is to fill the roles that the hiring manager asks them to. To fill these roles, they need to find candidates who meet the bar set by the hiring manager and the interview panel. Recruiters often have target numbers to hit, measured in the number of headcounts filled.

### The Sourcer

**The sourcer** proactively reaches out on LinkedIn and other channels to "source" people: to get them interested in starting the process. In large companies, sourcers exclusively do reachouts and sell the position via conversations. As soon as someone who has a good profile is interested, they hand this person over to the recruiter. The goal of the sourcer is to get as many qualified candidates in the pipeline as possible, and they usually have target numbers to hit.

### The Inbound Sourcer

**The inbound sourcer** screens all incoming job applications through the company jobs site. This is a specialized role at larger companies, particularly Silicon Valley-based ones. At large companies, there could be hundreds of applications per week for each role. With tens or hundreds of roles, just going through these can take multiple people, full-time. Referrals will usually go either to inbound sourcers or to recruiters, with a priority over other applications. The goal of the inbound sourcer is to get qualified candidates forwarded to the recruiter. At the same time, they need to not waste the recruiter's time with people who don't meet the expectations set by the hiring manager.

### The Recruitment Coordinator

**The recruitment coordinator** manages the logistics of the process. Once you make it through the recruitment chat, and it's time for the technical phone screen or onsite, this is where they join in. They schedule times with you and with the interview panel. This can be more complex than you'd assume. If an interviewer cannot make it, they swap them out for a replacement. If something comes up on your end, they reschedule the interview for you. If you get invited to travel onsite, they take care of the logistics of booking transport and accommodation. The goal of the recruitment coordinator is to make sure things flow smoothly, and that everyone is happy and on time.

### The Interview Panel

**The interview panel** is the group of engineers who will lead the technical interviews at the technical onsite, from the coding challenge to the final onsite. They have usually gone through some training, have been calibrated, and the people usually specialize in doing specific interviews, like coding or design. The hiring manager selects this group. For small companies, this group will often be team members. For large companies, it can be a large pool of all engineers above a certain level who have taken the interview training. The goal of the interview panel members is to keep the hiring bar fair, consistent, and as bias-free as possible.

## How the Hiring Pipeline Works

Understanding the hiring pipeline helps you realize where your resume fits into the process and how crucial it is for getting past the initial screening stages.

### Stage 1: Application Submission

When you submit your application, your resume enters a pool with potentially hundreds of other candidates. This is where the first major filtering happens:

- **Inbound sourcers** or **recruiters** do the initial screening
- They spend seconds (not minutes) per resume
- Most resumes get rejected at this stage
- The goal is to identify the top 5-10% of applicants

### Stage 2: Recruiter Screen

If your resume passes the initial filter, you get a recruiter call:

- 15-30 minute phone conversation
- Recruiter assesses basic qualifications and fit
- They explain the role and company culture
- They gauge your interest and timeline
- Another significant dropoff happens here

### Stage 3: Technical Phone Screen

For candidates who pass the recruiter screen:

- Usually a 45-60 minute technical interview
- May involve coding, system design, or technical discussion
- Conducted by an engineer from the team
- This is often the biggest filter in the process

### Stage 4: Onsite Interview (or Virtual Onsite)

The final stage for most companies:

- Multiple rounds of interviews (usually 4-6 hours total)
- Different interviewers test different skills
- Coding, system design, behavioral questions
- Team fit and culture assessment

### Stage 5: Decision and Offer

After the onsite:

- Interview panel and hiring manager discuss
- Decision typically made within a few days
- Offer negotiations if you're selected

## Why Your Resume Matters So Much

Looking at this pipeline, you can see why your resume is absolutely critical:

1. **It's your only chance to make a first impression** before anyone talks to you
2. **Most candidates are eliminated at the resume stage** - often 90% or more
3. **Recruiters and sourcers are looking for reasons to reject**, not reasons to accept
4. **You're competing against hundreds of other resumes** for just a few interview slots

Your resume needs to be strong enough to:
- Survive the 7-second scan
- Land in the "Yes" pile instead of "Maybe" or "No"
- Make the recruiter excited to talk to you
- Clearly demonstrate you meet the job requirements

## From the Inside Out: How Recruiters Prioritize Resumes

*Insights from technical recruiters at various tech companies:*

"When I open a new batch of applications, I'm not trying to find the perfect candidate. I'm trying to eliminate as many as possible, as quickly as possible. Here's roughly how I prioritize:

**First Priority: Referrals** - These go to the top of the pile. If someone internal referred you, I'm much more likely to give your resume a thorough read.

**Second Priority: Direct matches** - If your resume clearly shows you've done exactly what we're looking for, you get attention quickly.

**Third Priority: Strong company names** - If you've worked at companies we respect, I'll spend more time reading.

**Everything else** gets the quick scan treatment. I'm looking for immediate red flags or immediate green flags. No middle ground in the first pass."

## Common Mistakes That Kill Resumes in the Pipeline

Understanding the pipeline helps you avoid common mistakes:

### Resume Mistakes That Cause Immediate Rejection:
- **Poor formatting** that's hard to scan quickly
- **Too long** - more than 2 pages for most engineers
- **No clear contact information**
- **Obvious spelling/grammar errors**
- **Irrelevant information** that doesn't relate to the job
- **No clear career progression** or growth story
- **Generic descriptions** that could apply to anyone
- **Missing key technical skills** mentioned in the job description

### Resume Elements That Create Positive Impressions:
- **Clear, scannable format** with good use of whitespace
- **Quantified achievements** with specific numbers and impact
- **Relevant technical skills** prominently displayed
- **Clear career progression** showing growth over time
- **Company/project names** that are recognizable or impressive
- **Action-oriented language** that shows what you accomplished

## How Different Company Sizes Handle the Pipeline

The hiring pipeline varies significantly based on company size:

### Startup (1-50 employees):
- Hiring manager often does initial resume screening
- Fewer formal processes
- More emphasis on culture fit and adaptability
- Faster decision making

### Mid-size Company (50-500 employees):
- Dedicated recruiters for screening
- More structured interview process
- Balance between speed and thoroughness
- Growing emphasis on specific skills

### Large Company (500+ employees):
- Specialized roles (inbound sourcers, coordinators, etc.)
- Highly structured and standardized process
- Multiple rounds of screening
- Strong emphasis on meeting specific criteria

Understanding which type of company you're applying to can help you tailor your resume appropriately.

## Key Takeaways for Resume Writing

Based on how the hiring pipeline works:

1. **Your resume must work in seconds, not minutes**
2. **Focus on making it easy for recruiters to say "yes"**
3. **Tailor your resume to the specific role and company**
4. **Eliminate any elements that could cause immediate rejection**
5. **Make your relevant experience and skills immediately obvious**
6. **Use formatting that supports quick scanning**

Remember: your resume's job is not to get you hired. Your resume's job is to get you to the next stage of the pipeline - that first recruiter call. Everything in your resume should be optimized for this single goal.
