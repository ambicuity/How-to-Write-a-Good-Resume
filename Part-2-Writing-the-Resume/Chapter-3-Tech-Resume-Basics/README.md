# Chapter 3: Tech Resume Basics

Now that we understand why resumes matter and how the hiring pipeline works, let's dive into the fundamentals of writing a strong tech resume. This chapter covers the essential elements that every developer resume should have and the basic principles that guide effective resume writing.

## Core Principles of Tech Resume Writing

### Principle 1: Optimize for Scanning, Not Reading

Remember that recruiters and hiring managers spend only seconds scanning your resume initially. This means:

- **Use clear, scannable formatting** with plenty of whitespace
- **Put the most important information first** in each section
- **Use bullet points** instead of long paragraphs
- **Make key information stand out** with bold text or strategic formatting
- **Keep sections well-organized** with clear headings

### Principle 2: Show Impact, Not Just Activities

Instead of listing what you did, focus on what you achieved:

- **Bad**: "Worked on the user authentication system"
- **Good**: "Built user authentication system that reduced login failures by 40% and improved security compliance"
- **Bad**: "Participated in code reviews"
- **Good**: "Led code review process that caught 85% of bugs before production, reducing post-deployment issues by 60%"

### Principle 3: Quantify Everything Possible

Numbers make your achievements concrete and memorable:

- Performance improvements: "Optimized database queries, reducing load time from 3s to 800ms"
- Scale: "Built system handling 1M+ daily active users"
- Team impact: "Mentored 3 junior developers, with 2 receiving promotions"
- Business impact: "Feature increased user engagement by 25%"

### Principle 4: Tailor for the Specific Role

Your resume should be customized for each position:

- **Highlight relevant technologies** mentioned in the job description
- **Emphasize experience** that directly relates to the role
- **Use similar language** to what appears in the job posting
- **Order information** to put the most relevant items first

## Essential Resume Sections

### Contact Information

Your contact section should include:

**Required:**
- Full name
- Professional email address (firstname.lastname@gmail.com format preferred)
- Phone number
- Location (city, state/country - no need for full address)

**Optional but Recommended:**
- LinkedIn profile URL
- GitHub profile URL
- Personal website/portfolio (if relevant and professional)

**Avoid:**
- Unprofessional email addresses
- Photos (unless specifically requested)
- Social media profiles (except LinkedIn/GitHub)
- Full home address

### Professional Summary/Objective

A brief 2-3 line summary can be valuable if done well:

**Good Summary Example:**
"Senior Full-Stack Developer with 5+ years building scalable web applications. Expert in React, Node.js, and AWS with experience leading teams of 4+ developers. Passionate about performance optimization and user experience."

**Bad Summary Example:**
"Passionate developer looking for opportunities to grow and learn in a dynamic environment where I can contribute to innovative projects."

**When to skip the summary:**
- If you can't write something specific and compelling
- If you're short on space
- If your experience speaks for itself

### Technical Skills

This section is crucial for tech resumes:

**Organization Options:**
1. **By category**: Languages, Frameworks, Databases, Tools, etc.
2. **By proficiency**: Expert, Proficient, Familiar
3. **Simple list**: All skills in order of relevance

**Best Practices:**
- List skills relevant to the job first
- Be honest about proficiency levels
- Include years of experience for key technologies
- Keep it current - remove outdated technologies

**Example:**
```
Technical Skills:
• Languages: Python (5 years), JavaScript (4 years), Java (3 years)
• Frontend: React, Vue.js, HTML5, CSS3, TypeScript
• Backend: Node.js, Django, FastAPI, RESTful APIs
• Databases: PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis
• Tools: Docker, Kubernetes, AWS, Git, Jenkins
```

### Work Experience

This is typically the most important section:

**Format for Each Role:**
```
Job Title | Company Name | Location | Dates
• Achievement-focused bullet point with quantified impact
• Another specific accomplishment with numbers
• Technical contribution that shows your skills
```

**Best Practices:**
- List experience in reverse chronological order
- Use action verbs to start each bullet point
- Focus on achievements, not responsibilities
- Include relevant technologies used
- Quantify impact whenever possible
- Keep most recent roles more detailed

### Projects Section

Especially important for:
- New graduates
- Career changers
- Developers with gaps in employment
- Showcasing specific technical skills

**For Each Project Include:**
- Project name and brief description
- Technologies used
- Your specific role/contribution
- Results or impact (if measurable)
- Link to code/demo (if available and professional)

### Education

**For Recent Graduates (0-2 years experience):**
- List education before work experience
- Include relevant coursework
- Mention GPA if 3.5 or higher
- Include academic projects

**For Experienced Developers (3+ years):**
- List education after work experience
- Keep it brief: degree, school, year
- Skip GPA and coursework
- Focus space on work experience instead

## Resume Length Guidelines

### One Page vs. Two Pages

**One page is ideal for:**
- New graduates
- Developers with 0-3 years of experience
- Career changers
- When you can fit everything important on one page

**Two pages is acceptable for:**
- Senior developers with 5+ years of experience
- Technical leads and managers
- When you have significant achievements that warrant the space
- Never go beyond two pages

### Content Priority

When you need to cut content to fit:

1. **Keep**: Recent work experience, relevant technical skills, measurable achievements
2. **Condense**: Older work experience (3+ years old), less relevant projects
3. **Remove**: Irrelevant work experience, outdated technical skills, personal information

## Common Formatting Guidelines

### Font and Typography

- **Use professional fonts**: Arial, Calibri, Helvetica, or similar
- **Font size**: 10-12pt for body text, larger for headings
- **Be consistent**: Same font family throughout
- **Use formatting strategically**: Bold for emphasis, not decoration

### Spacing and Layout

- **Consistent margins**: 0.5-1 inch on all sides
- **White space**: Don't cram everything together
- **Alignment**: Keep elements aligned and organized
- **Section breaks**: Clear separation between sections

### File Format

- **Always use PDF** for final submission
- **Name your file professionally**: "FirstName_LastName_Resume.pdf"
- **Test your PDF**: Make sure it displays correctly on different devices

## Technologies to Highlight

### Always Include

- **Programming languages** you're proficient in
- **Frameworks and libraries** you've used professionally
- **Databases** you've worked with
- **Cloud platforms** (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud)
- **Development tools** (Git, Docker, etc.)

### Consider Including

- **Methodologies**: Agile, Scrum, TDD
- **Soft skills**: If you can quantify them
- **Certifications**: If they're relevant and current
- **Languages**: If relevant to the job

### Usually Skip

- **Basic computer skills**: Microsoft Office, etc.
- **Outdated technologies**: Unless specifically requested
- **Technologies you've only used briefly**
- **Soft skills without evidence**

## Writing Effective Bullet Points

### The STAR Method

Structure your accomplishments using:
- **Situation**: Context of the challenge
- **Task**: What needed to be done
- **Action**: What you specifically did
- **Result**: The measurable outcome

### Action Verbs for Tech Resumes

**Development**: Built, Developed, Implemented, Created, Designed
**Improvement**: Optimized, Enhanced, Improved, Streamlined, Upgraded
**Leadership**: Led, Managed, Mentored, Coordinated, Directed
**Problem-solving**: Solved, Resolved, Debugged, Analyzed, Investigated
**Impact**: Delivered, Achieved, Increased, Reduced, Generated

### Examples of Strong Bullet Points

- "Built real-time chat feature using WebSockets and Redis, supporting 10K+ concurrent users with 99.9% uptime"
- "Optimized database queries and implemented caching, reducing API response time from 2.3s to 400ms"
- "Led migration from monolith to microservices architecture, improving deployment speed by 70% and system reliability"
- "Mentored 2 junior developers through code reviews and pair programming, both received promotions within 18 months"

## Key Takeaways

1. **Optimize for quick scanning** - use clear formatting and structure
2. **Focus on achievements and impact** - not just job duties
3. **Quantify everything possible** - numbers make your accomplishments concrete
4. **Tailor your resume** for each specific role and company
5. **Keep it concise** - one page for new grads, two pages max for experienced developers
6. **Use professional formatting** - PDF format, clean typography, consistent spacing
7. **Highlight relevant technical skills** - match the job requirements
8. **Write compelling bullet points** - use action verbs and show results

Remember: your resume is a marketing document, not a comprehensive career history. Every line should either demonstrate your qualifications for the specific role or differentiate you from other candidates.
